# Paramiko Pi

These are the wheels that are neccesary
for installing paramiko and/or PyNaCl
on the Raspberry Pi. You may only need
the PyNaCl wheel

**These are for ARM7l *not* ARM64, Aarch64, or any other ARM Architecture!**

## IMPORTANT:

THESE FILES MAY MOT BE UP TO DATE. THEY
WERE MADE FOR THE CONVINIENCE OF
INSTALLING WebSSH (https://github.com/huashengdun/webssh)
WITHOUT THE NEED TO COMPILE THESE WHEELS
MANUALLY, AS SOME OF THEM DO NOT SEEM TO
BE AVAILABLE AT www.pywheels.com AS OF
DECEMBER 2019. THERE IS NO WARRENTY,
AND I DONT GUARENTEE THESE TO WORK.
